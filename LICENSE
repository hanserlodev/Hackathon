"You" refers to the licensee, or person using the work.

"Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work.

for infringement under applicable copyright law.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program,
and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program
or a work on which the Program is based.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.

any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
